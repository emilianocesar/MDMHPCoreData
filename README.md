# MDMHPCoreData

Source code and slides for High Performance Core Data talk given at [CocoaConf in Atlanta](http://cocoaconf.com/conference/sessionDetails/348?confId=13). Visit [High Performance Core Data](http://highperformancecoredata.com) for updates.

> Learn how to analyze, debug, and squeeze every last bit of performance out of Core Data. The standard Core Data implementation is very powerful and flexible but lacks performance. This advanced talk covers various performance analysis tools, data model optimization, and various high performance concurrency models. This is an advanced discussion that assumes you have used Core Data before.
